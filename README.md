Please find in the screenshot file the screenshots of our frontend.


Task distribution:

Lily created most of the home page and the connexion to the server. Romain was in the charge of the visual of the site. Gaspard created most of the search requests, page details, application forms and established connection to Node for these elements.Since we've worked on multiple projects together, we had multiple sessions to work as a group and help each other out. So everyone  was partly involved in every part.
